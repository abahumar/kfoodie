# Roti Titab

If you haven't had **Roti Titab**, you haven't been to Kelantan. Originated by *Kopitiam Kita*, this thick toast topped with generous dollops of kaya (coconut jam) and a perfectly half-boiled egg is the ultimate breakfast.

## The Experience
The shop is often packed with locals and dignitaries alike. The walls are adorned with photos of famous visitors.
